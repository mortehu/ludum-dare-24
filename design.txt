Evolution:

  - Population
  - No intelligent design
  - Changes happen randomly across generations
  - Death from entropy is inevitable

Game A: The Selfish Gene

  - The core gameplay is killing off individuals with undesired attributes by
    touching them

  - Individiuals live on a circular map made entirely of a material that breaks
    down easily into building materials and energy

  - The atmosphere has two parts: oxygen, carbon

  - Traits are visible:

     - green: converts atmospheric C+O + H+O into O and C+H
              grows until it dies
              after a certain age, makes copies
              very low power

     - beige: converts atmospheric O and C+H into C+O and H+O
              grows until a certain age, before it starts making smaller copies

     - XXX: predator: eats smaller individuals

     - XXX: altruist: gives away food to nearby starving individuals sharing
                      this gene

     - power: generates power from own mass more efficiently

     - tail: locomotion: swims around.  longer tail is faster.  uses power.

     - yellow head: fear: turns away from predators

     - red dots: tetrodotoxin: kills whoever eats it

     - aversion: avoids eating red dots

Game B: Blob Defense

  - Core mechanic: Kill unwanted individuals.  Divide traits you want to duplicate

  - Your individuals live in a circle fighting an onslaught of spiky things
    damaging your membrane

  - Traits:

    - Muzzle velocity  (consumes energy)
    - Projectile mass  (consumes mass)
    - Aim              (consumes energy)
    - Repair           (consumes energy and mass)
    - Catabolism       (convert mass to energy)
    - Anabolism        (converts energy to mass)
    - XXX              (store energy)
    - YYY              (store mass)

  - Energy comes constantly from the sun

  - Mass comes from killed baddies and the initial
